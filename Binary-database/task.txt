# Binary Database

Dear sir, I present to you, my new database management software, very high
performant sir, is written in C!

I send to you demo server to try, please test it locally but also buy cloud
service at `isc2024.1337.cx:10150`

If you find any bugs, please and I will fix it sir!


### Hints:

  - please don't complain about the source code, Ghidra / IDA Pro / BinNinja...
  - there are two flags, one is easy, the other one is more fun ;)
  - the server has lots of mistakes, but only a few are remotely exploitable;
  - don't forget to read everything from the socket (until it closes) in order to
  	catch everything printed after the exploit!
  - for bonus: libc is still PIC, so ASLR will do its job proper...
  - note: generic ROP gadgets are NOT available :(( you can still find some
    useful ones, though;
  - after succeeding locally, make sure to run your exploit on the server!
  - you should use some tooling on this one (e.g., python + pwntools);
  - you can also use pwntools' `remote()` for opening a socket pipe in Python!
  - for the bonus flag: `cp -f init-test.db init.db` to experiment with its
  	memory layout!
