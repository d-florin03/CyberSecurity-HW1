# CyberSecurity-HW1
Cryptography, linux authentication &amp; access control, binary reverse&amp;exploit

Each task challenges you to find a "flag", a string with the form
`SpeishFlag{<random hash>}` (internal joke).
There is a single flag per task: if you got 
one with the appropriate syntax, it will be accepted as the correct solution 
(please take care when decoding or manually copying it, e.g. zero vs 'o').
